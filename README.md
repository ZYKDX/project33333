### Project Objective

Landing a job (or an internship) is a big topic for Computer Science students. However, after using a lot of online career development forums, we find that the information was very ineffective and thus of limited help.<br />
This is mainly due to the large difference in background among users, for example, as an align student, after I read an interview experience that was rated as ‘easy’ but found that the author is a developer with many years of work experience,
the reference value of this rating will then become very low immediately. Considering this, we plan to build a career development site for NEU students and help users land an internship or new grad position.<br />
We will make sure that our users are NEU students by verifying @northeastern.com email addresses when users register for accounts.<br />
In our forum, users can post their job-hunting experiences, publish job-hunting information, and share their interview experience. A user could post new experience, and read experiences shared by other users. When user A is interested in user B’s sharing, A could easily see B’s information by clicking ‘contact author’ button and discuss more details with B.
